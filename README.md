# excel_database
Treat Excel Files as Database and each sheets as tables - the script will be able to perform SQL operations on the Excel.

1. Please note : earlier i tried with CSV, then since changed it to Excel - the program name is excel_database.py
2. Run excel_database.py - install dependencies
3. You need to have a db.xlsx inside db folder - with sheets
4. First time when you run it creates a database and inserts the rows
5. Second time - it checks if the database exist and records exist and add based on that.
